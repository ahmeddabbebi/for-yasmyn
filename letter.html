    <h1>💌 A Letter for You</h1>
    <p class="letter-text">
      My love,<br><br>
      I want you to know how deeply I love you. Every single day, I wake up feeling grateful that you're in my life. You're not just my girlfriend — you're my soulmate, my best friend, and the person I want to build forever with.<br><br>
      I know you're leaving next month for Germany, and as much as it hurts to be apart, I am so proud of you. I believe in us, in our bond, in our future together. While I wait for my visa, not a day will go by without me thinking of you and imagining the day I’ll be by your side again — in a new country, with new dreams, and our same love, stronger than ever.<br><br>
      This is just the beginning of our story. Soon, we’ll be holding hands walking through German streets, laughing, exploring, and building our life together.<br><br>
      I miss you already, but I’ll be patient... because you're worth everything. I love you — now, always, and endlessly. ❤️<br><br>
      Yours forever,<br>
      Ahmed
